Brought to you by Lighthouse Labs

## Getting Started

1. `bundle install`
2. `shotgun -p 3000 -o 0.0.0.0`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
4. To see a demo account, login with the username: and password: .


Features of the app
1. Users can record matches against their friends.*
2. Users can see an overview of their matches against all friends, and then drill down to history against a specific friend, sorted by game.
3. Users can send a "Reset history" request to a friend for specific games, and erasing associated matches.*
4. Users can see all of their reset requests on one page, sorted by received, pending and completed.*

*Features I implemented.

To Do
1. Have users confirm matches that other friends have entered against them. Right now, I can add matches and skew the records.
2. On the new match form, change the Opponent User Name input to an autocomplete text field instead of a dropdown menu.
3. Redesign the look.
